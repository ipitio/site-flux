# FLUX

This is the website for FLUX (<https://fluxaz.org>), made with Astro, Svelte with Runes, and Tailwind CSS.

## Development

To run the development server:

1. Install Docker and Compose (Included in Docker Desktop).
2. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the following command to start the development server:

   ```bash
   docker compose up --watch
    ```

4. Open your browser and go to <http://localhost:4321> to view the site. The site will automatically reload when you make changes to the source files.
5. To stop the server, press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal where the command is running.

## Deployment

To deploy the site, simply create a pull request to the `master` branch. Once approved, your changes will be automatically deployed to the production server.
